# RefImporter

RefImporter is a Windows Forms application developed in C# (.NET Framework). Its main purpose appears to be providing a graphical user interface for importing references, though the exact feature set should be clarified by the project owner or further code analysis.

## Features

- Windows Forms-based GUI (`ImporterGUI`)
- Main entry point launches the graphical interface
- Assembly information and versioning included

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework (compatible with Windows Forms)
- Visual Studio or compatible IDE

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdolfotULS/RefImporter.git
    ```
2. Open the solution file (`RefImporter.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies.
4. Run the application.

### Usage

When you run the program, it will open the main GUI window. From there, you can use the interface to import references (details of the functionality depend on further code or documentation).

## Project Structure

- `Program.cs`: Main entry point, launches the GUI.
- `View/ImporterGUI.cs`: The main form for the application.
- `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`: Assembly metadata and versioning.
